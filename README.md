# KeccakRust

A Rust port of [KeccakKotlin](https://github.com/ronhombre/KeccakKotlin) utilizing
[neo-rust-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/ronhombre/neo-rust-gradle-plugin). This is a proof of concept project for
building Rust Gradle projects using my plugin.

In the future, this will be integrated into **KeccakKotlin** as a native backend, and the Kotlin code will remain untouched
as a backup for platforms I can't build a binary for. (_This seems illogical given KMP is supposed to provide a common
language for multiple platforms. However, the main goal here is to prove Rust can be built with Gradle using my plugin
and to learn Rust myself._)

Currently, this project is under work in progress. Only a "Hello World" has been made. Run it with `./gradlew runTest`.

(Note Nov 1st, 2025: If the Gradle plugin is not yet available in Gradle Plugin Portal by the time you're reading this,
you need to build **neo-rust-gradle-plugin** and publish it locally using
`./gradlew publishPluginMavenPublicationToMavenLocal`. At the moment, I'm still waiting for Gradle to approve my
plugin.)

This is a copy of the generated `Cargo.toml` by my plugin given the current `build.gradle.kts`.
